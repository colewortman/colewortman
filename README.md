## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Web development has been a passion of mine ever since I worked on my first full-stack web project. The experience drove me to continue learning and developing my skills.

One project Iâ€™m especially proud of is Event Planner, a full-stack application that integrates a PostgreSQL database, an Express.JS API, and a React frontend. I used Docker for containerization and set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment. 
This project was particulary rewarding because it allowed me to have hands-on experience with modern development workflows and building scalable, production-ready applications.
You can find the project here: https://github.com/colewortman/event-planner.

I'm currently searching for a role in backend software engineering where I can grow my skills, ideally writing in JavaScript or Go. If you're hiring, let's chat!
