## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Web development has been a passion of mine ever since I worked on my first full-stack web project. The experience drove me to continue learning and developing my skills.
I'm currently searching for a role in backend web development where I can grow my skills, ideally writing in JavaScript or Go. If you're hiring, let's chat!
